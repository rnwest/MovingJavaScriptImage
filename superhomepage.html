				<p>Hey you!  Yes, YOU!  Did you know you have superpowers?  In fact, everyone does! 
	Your friends, your teachers, and all of your family have the amazing ability to tell the 
	difference between right and wrong.  It's this superpower that helps Spider-Man 
	web-sling, and Superman save cats out of trees; it's the reason you become a hero in the 
	first place! Some people's sense of right and wrong is stronger than others, to test yours, 
	check out the "W.W.Y.D" tab.  To help Superman save the cats of Metropolis, click the
	"Game" tab.  If you want to know how to be a hero, compare yourself to them with the
	"Heroes" tab. </p>
